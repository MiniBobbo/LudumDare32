That is proposterous!  You clearly forgot about the existance of * while formulating your feeble argument!
I have one word for you...  *!
How can that be true with the ever present force that * exerts on the world?
How approperiate.  You fight like a *!
Of course that's not true, you silly *!
* I said and * I meant.  A philosppher's faithful 100%
What?  Have you seen the state of * recently?  Clearly your view is clouded.
How can we trust the opinions of someone who thinks the Illuminati is headed by a giant *?
Your views are outdated.  Have you read a * recently?
Simply rediculous!  * have proved this over and over again!
Life is *, your Highness.  Anyone who says otherwise is selling something.
People who live in glass houses shouldn't throw *s!
Are you suggesting * migrate?
If you love * so much, why don't you marry it?
Platypi, Otters, and * can all survivve underwater for over 10 minutes!
*s fall, everyone dies.
By the power of Grey*!
A * doesn't exist in nature.
